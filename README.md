## to_Start_with_the_project
As i have working on a project and i need to work with State management for my flutter application,
typical state managing is quite messy, so...
I have chosen Redux. That's because form many others state management technology redux will reduce 
lots of code.

When i was searching for resources i found quite a few shows a clean way how to use it for
multiple page. Only it was used for big project, and quite hard for understanding at first.
so i decided to make my this project and tried implement as simple as possible.
